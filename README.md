# Battle Snake 2018<a id="sec-0" name="sec-0"></a>

A simple [BattleSnake](https://www.battlesnake.io) written in Java. Entered in the 2018 Intermediate competition.

## Strategy<a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a>

Our snake's strategy was aggresive. For each turn, if the snake wasn't the largest on the board, or if the health was below a specific threshold, the snake would navigate towards the safest food. Otherwise, she would try to target other snakes' heads to either eliminate the opponent in a head-on collision or trap them by cutting off their path. The snake also included an unimplemented passive state, where she would try to loop back around to her tail to avoid collisions.

### Drawbacks<a id="sec-1-1" name="sec-1-1"></a>

The snake's biggest drawback was trapping itself in its own tail. We didn't implement an effective algorithm to calculate dangerous regions of the board, and ultimately the snake only died by running out of moves.
